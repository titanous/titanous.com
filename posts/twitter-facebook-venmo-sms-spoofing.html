          <date datetime="2012-12-03T12:25:00-04:00" pubdate="pubdate" title="2012-12-03 12:25 ">December 3, 2012</date><p><strong>Update</strong>: Twitter has fixed the issue for users of short codes. Users that use
          a “long code” should enable the PIN code in their account.</p>
          
          <p>Twitter users with SMS enabled are vulnerable to an attack that allows anyone to
          post to their account. The attacker only needs knowledge of the mobile number
          associated with a target’s Twitter account. Messages can then be sent to Twitter
          with the source number spoofed.</p>
          
          <p>Like email, the originating address of a SMS cannot be trusted. Many SMS
          gateways allow the originating address of a message to be set to an arbitrary
          identifier, including someone else’s number.</p>
          
          <p>Facebook and Venmo were also vulnerable to the same spoofing attack, but
          the issues were resolved after disclosing to their respective security teams.</p>
          
          <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
          
          <h3 id="users">Users</h3>
          
          <p>Users of Twitter that have a mobile number associated with their account and
          have not set a PIN code are vulnerable. All of the Twitter <a href="http://support.twitter.com/articles/14020-twitter-sms-commands">SMS
          commands</a> can be
          used by an attacker, including the ability to post tweets and modify profile
          info.</p>
          
          <h3 id="service-providers">Service Providers</h3>
          
          <p>All services that trust the originating address of SMS messages implicitly and
          are not using a short code are vulnerable.</p>
          
          <h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h2>
          
          <h3 id="users-1">Users</h3>
          
          <p>Until Twitter removes the ability to post via non-short code numbers, users
          should enable PIN codes (if available in their region) or disable the mobile
          text messaging feature.</p>
          
          <p>Twitter has a PIN code feature that requires every message to be prepended
          with a four-digit alphanumeric code. This feature mitigates the issue, but is
          not available to users inside the United States.</p>
          
          <h3 id="service-providers-1">Service Providers</h3>
          
          <p>The cleanest solution for providers is to use only an SMS short code to receive
          incoming messages. In most cases, messages to short codes do not leave the
          carrier network and can only be sent by subscribers. This removes the ease of
          spoofing via SMS gateways.</p>
          
          <p>An alternative, less user-friendly but more secure solution is to require
          a challenge-response for every message. After receiving an SMS, the service
          would reply with a short alphanumeric string that needs to be repeated back
          before the message is processed.</p>

          <p>The issue I filed was initially inspected by a member of their security team,
          but was then routed to the normal support team who did not believe that SMS
          spoofing was possible. I then reached out directly to someone on the security
          team who said that it was an “old issue” but that they did not want me to
          publish until they got “a fix in place”. I received no further communication
          from Twitter.</p>

          <p>Initially Facebook did not respond to my report on their security vulnerability
          page. I then emailed a friend who works at Facebook, who facilitated my contact
          with their security team.</p>

          <p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I will receive a bounty from Facebook for finding and reporting
          this issue to them. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/bounty/">Facebook bounty
          program</a> requires responsible
          disclosure and time to resolve internally in “good faith” before publishing.</p>
          
          <h3 id="venmo">Venmo</h3>
          
          <p>I initially disclosed this issue to Venmo support, as they do not have
          a security contact published. When I did not receive a response, I notified the
          Braintree security team (Braintree <a href="http://blog.venmo.com/post/29565341097/venmo-joins-braintree">recently
          acquired</a> Venmo),
          who responded very promptly.</p>

              <tr>
                <td>1 Dec 2012</td>
                <td>I received confirmation that Venmo SMS payments have been disabled, mitigating the vulnerability.</td>
