  <h1><a href="/posts/docker-insecurity">Docker Image Insecurity</a></h1>
  <date datetime="2014-12-23T11:30:00-04:00" pubdate="pubdate" title="2014-12-23 11:30 ">December 23, 2014</date><p>Recently while downloading an “official” container image with Docker I saw this line:</p>

<pre><code>ubuntu:14.04: The image you are pulling has been verified
</code></pre>

<p>I assumed this referenced Docker’s <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2014/10/docker-1-3-signed-images-process-injection-security-options-mac-shared-directories/">heavily
promoted</a>
image signing system and didn’t investigate further at the time. Later, while
researching the cryptographic digest system that Docker tries to secure images
with, I had the opportunity to explore further. What I found was a total
systemic failure of all logic related to image security.</p>

<p>Docker’s report that a downloaded image is “verified” is based solely on the
presence of a signed manifest, and Docker never verifies the image checksum from
the manifest. An attacker could provide any image alongside a signed manifest.
This opens the door to a number of serious vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Images are downloaded from an HTTPS server and go through an insecure streaming
processing pipeline in the Docker daemon:</p>

<pre><code>[decompress] -&gt; [tarsum] -&gt; [unpack]
</code></pre>

<p>This pipeline is performant but completely insecure. Untrusted input should not
be processed before verifying its signature. Unfortunately Docker processes
images three times before checksum verification is supposed to occur.</p>

<p>However, despite <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2014/10/docker-1-3-signed-images-process-injection-security-options-mac-shared-directories/">Docker’s
claims</a>,
image checksums are never actually checked. This is the only section<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" class="footnote">0</a></sup> of
Docker’s code related to verifying image checksums, and I was unable to trigger
the warning even when presenting images with mismatched checksums.</p>

<pre><code>if img.Checksum != "" &amp;&amp; img.Checksum != checksum {
  log.Warnf("image layer checksum mismatch: computed %q,
             expected %q", checksum, img.Checksum)
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="insecure-processing-pipeline">Insecure processing pipeline</h2>

<h3 id="decompress">Decompress</h3>

<p>Docker supports three compression algorithms: gzip, bzip2, and xz. The first two
use the Go standard library implementations, which are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety">memory-safe</a>, so the exploit
types I’d expect to see here are denial of service attacks like crashes and
excessive CPU and memory usage.</p>

<p>The third compression algorithm, xz, is more interesting. Since there is no
native Go implementation, Docker
<a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/0874f9ab77a7957633cd835241a76ee4406196d8/pkg/archive/archive.go#L91-L95">execs</a>
the <code>xz</code> binary to do the decompression.</p>

<p>The <code>xz</code> binary comes from the <a href="http://tukaani.org/xz/">XZ Utils</a> project, and
is built from approximately<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> twenty thousand lines of C code. C is not
a memory-safe language. This means malicious input to a C program, in this case
the Docker image XZ Utils is unpacking, could potentially execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>Docker exacerbates this situation by <em>running <code>xz</code> as root</em>. This means that if
there is a single vulnerability in <code>xz</code>, a call to <code>docker pull</code> could result in
the complete compromise of your entire system.</p>

<h3 id="tarsum">Tarsum</h3>

<p>The use of tarsum is well-meaning but completely flawed. In order to get
a deterministic checksum of the contents of an arbitrarily encoded tar file,
Docker decodes the tar and then hashes specific portions, while excluding
others, in a <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/0874f9ab77a7957633cd835241a76ee4406196d8/pkg/tarsum/tarsum_spec.md">deterministic
order</a>.</p>

<p>Since this processing is done in order to generate the checksum, it is decoding
untrusted data which could be designed to exploit the tarsum code<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Potential
exploits here are denial of service as well as logic flaws that could cause
files to be injected, skipped, processed differently, modified, appended to,
etc. without the checksum changing.</p>

<h3 id="unpacking">Unpacking</h3>

<p>Unpacking consists of decoding the tar and placing files on the disk. This is
extraordinarily dangerous as there have been three other vulnerabilities
reported<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> in the unpack stage at the time of writing.</p>

<p><strong>There is no situation where data that has not been verified should be unpacked
onto disk.</strong></p>

<h2 id="libtrust">libtrust</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/libtrust">libtrust</a> is a Docker package that claims
to provide “authorization and access control through a distributed trust graph.”
Unfortunately no specification appears to exist, however it looks like it
implements some parts of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-11">Javascript Object Signing and
Encryption</a>
specifications along with other unspecified algorithms.</p>

<p>Downloading an image with a manifest signed and verified using libtrust is what
triggers this inaccurate message (only the manifest is checked, not the actual
image contents):</p>

<pre><code>ubuntu:14.04: The image you are pulling has been verified
</code></pre>

<p>Currently only “official” image manifests published by Docker, Inc are signed
using this system, but from discussions I participated in at the last Docker
Governance Advisory Board meeting<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, my understanding is that Docker, Inc is
planning on deploying this more widely in the future. The intended goal is
centralization with Docker, Inc controlling a Certificate Authority that then
signs images and/or client certificates.</p>

<p>I looked for the signing key in Docker’s code but was unable to find it. As it
turns out the key is not embedded in the binary as one would expect. Instead the
Docker daemon fetches it <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/0874f9ab77a7957633cd835241a76ee4406196d8/trust/trusts.go#L38">over HTTPS from
a CDN</a>
before each image download. This is a terrible approach as a variety of attacks
could lead to trusted keys being replaced with malicious ones. These attacks
include but are not limited to: compromise of the CDN vendor, compromise of the
CDN origin serving the key, and man in the middle attacks on clients downloading
the keys.</p>

<h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9719">reported</a> some of the issues
I found with the tarsum system before I finished this research, but so far
nothing I have reported has been fixed.</p>

<p>Some steps I believe should be taken to improve the security of the Docker image
download system:</p>

<h3 id="drop-tarsum-and-actually-verify-image-digests">Drop tarsum and actually verify image digests</h3>

<p>Tarsum should not be used for security. Instead, images must be fully downloaded
and their cryptographic signatures verified before any processing takes place.</p>

<h3 id="add-privilege-isolation">Add privilege isolation</h3>

<p>Image processing steps that involve decompression or unpacking should be run in
isolated processes (containers?) that have only the bare minimum required
privileges to operate. There is no scenario where a decompression tool like <code>xz</code>
should be run as root.</p>

<h3 id="replace-libtrust">Replace libtrust</h3>

<p>Libtrust should be replaced with <a href="http://theupdateframework.com/">The Update
Framework</a> which is explicitly designed to solve
the real problems around signing software binaries. The threat model is very
comprehensive and addresses many things that have not been considered in
libtrust. There is a complete specification as well as a reference
implementation written in Python, and I have begun work on a <a href="https://github.com/flynn/go-tuf">Go
implementation</a> and welcome contributions.</p>

<p>As part of adding TUF to Docker, a local keystore should be added that maps root
keys to registry URLs so that users can have their own signing keys that are not
managed by Docker, Inc.</p>

<p>I would like to note that using non-Docker, Inc hosted registries is a very poor
user experience in general. Docker, Inc seems content with relegating third
party registries to second class status when there is no technical reason to do
so. This is a problem both for the ecosystem in general and the security of end
users. A comprehensive, decentralized security model for third party registries
is both necessary and desirable. I encourage Docker, Inc to take this into
consideration when redesigning their security model and image verification
system.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Docker users should be aware that the code responsible for downloading images is
shockingly insecure. Users should only download images whose provenance is
without question. At present, this does <em>not</em> include “trusted” images hosted by
Docker, Inc including the official Ubuntu and other base images.</p>

<p>The best option is to block <code>index.docker.io</code> locally, and download and verify
images manually before importing them into Docker using <code>docker load</code>. Red Hat’s
security blog has <a href="https://securityblog.redhat.com/2014/12/18/before-you-initiate-a-docker-pull/">a good post about
this</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to Lewis Marshall for pointing out the tarsums are never verified.</em></p>
